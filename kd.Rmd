Hello and welcome to my webzone! I'm currently a [Lecturer](http://www.stat.illinois.edu/people/faculty/dalpiaz.shtml) and [MS Academic Advisor](http://www.stat.illinois.edu/students/graduates.shtml) for the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/).

After a BS in Mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I did a Phd in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with [Ping Ma](http://malab.uga.edu/).

You've probably noticed a theme. Yes, I've spent a lot of time at UIUC. [I'm still mad we don't use UIUC anymore.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_currently_registered_Internet_domain_names) Oh well. Go Illini!
