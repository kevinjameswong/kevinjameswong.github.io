I enjoy running in my freetime! I have been tracking my jogging stats since January 31, 2018. Over the past `r Update_Date - Start_Date - 1` days, I have jogged `r sum(running$RunDistance)` miles across `r sum(running$RunDistance > 0)` different runs.

This is me during the 2019 Illinois Half Marathon! I ran 13.1 miles in 1:43:29.
