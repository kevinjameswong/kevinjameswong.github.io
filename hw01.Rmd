## (2 points) Exercise 1: Homework Policy

Please uncomment the following statement when you have read and agreed
to the [homework policy](http://stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com/homework-policy/).
To _uncomment_ a statement in _RMarkdown_ delete the `<!-- -->` surrounding
the content.

I have read and agree to abide by the policies and procedures laid 
out by the [homework policy](http://stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com/homework-policy/).
I understand that:

- I must independently write up solutions to homework problems.
    - Failure to do so will result in an academic integrity violation due to plagarism and more severe penalties.
- I must list the names of all collaborators that I work with at the top of
  my homework assignment.
- I understand that I can work with **at most** three other students in class. 
- I will turn in my homework by committing to the GitHub repository that was
  setup for me via GitHub classrooms.
    - There is no paper or e-mail turn-in available. 
- I must make all commits using `git` and _not_ the GitHub web interface.
    - If I do, I will lose all the points associated with the `git` commits.
- I will be able to drop one homework assignment over the course of the 
  semester.

## (10 Points) Exercise 5: Got baby?

**[2 Points] (a)** Install and load the `babynames` package. 
**Comment** out the installation command in your `.Rmd` file. 
(If you do not comment installation commands out, then they will be run
every time you knit your `.Rmd` file.) 

```{r install-babynames}
#install.packages("babynames")
library(babynames)
```

**[2 Points] (b)** Open up the help documentation for `babynames` (the data set),
find where the variables for the data set are listed and write in your
_RMarkdown_ document _how_ the `prop` variable was created.

```{r help-babynames}
help(babynames)
```

`prop` was calculated by `n` divided by total number of applicants in that year, which means proportions are of people of that gender with that name born in that year


**[6 Points] (c)** Provide summary information on the `babynames` by:

- writing a sentence that _dynamically_ describes the dimensions of the data;
- showing the last six observations in the data set; and,
- providing a summary overview of the data to understand its contents.

```{r babynames-data-description}
nrow(babynames)
ncol(babynames)
tail(babynames)
```

There are `r ncol(babynames)` variables and `r nrow(babynames)` observations.
The variables are `year`, `sex`, `name`, `n`, and `prop`.

- `year` - the year the child was born
- `sex` - male or female
- `name` the name of the child
- `n` - the number of children with that name
- `prop` - `n` divided by total number of applicants in that year, which means proportions are of people of that gender with that name born in that year

##  (12 Points) Exercise 6: Excellency at UIUC

Under this exercise, we will explore the "Teachers Ranked As Excellent" data
at UIUC from Fall 1993 to Present as compiled by [Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider
](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/). Please download the data from:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wadefagen/Teachers-Ranked-As-Excellent-UIUC/master/TRE-UIUC-AllYears.csv> 

This data has a file extension of **CSV** form. Contained in the data are the
following variables:

- `term`: Two letter semester code (`sp`, `su`, `fa`, or `wi`) followed by a four digit year.
    - Examples: `sp2017`, `fa2013`, `su2012`.
- `unit`: The CITL-supplied headers for the unit teaching the course.
    - Examples: `ACCOUNTANCY`, `SOCIAL WORK`, `LINGUISTICS`, `NUCLEAR, PLASMA & RAD. ENGR.`
- `lname`: The last name of the teacher.
    - Examples: `FAGEN-ULMSCHNEIDER`, `FLANAGAN`, `FLECK`
- `fname`: The first letter of the first name of the teacher.
    - Examples: `W`, `K`, `M`
- `role`: `Instructor` or `TA`
- `ranking`: `Excellent` or `Outstanding`
- `course`: The course the teacher was ranked as excellent.  If no course is given, the `course` field is set to `?` (this includes cases when the raw data lists the course as `0`, `000`, or `999`).
    - Examples: `199`, `225`, `560`, `?`

**[2 points] (a)** Import into _R_ the data in `TRE-UIUC-AllYears.csv` with the 
variable name `tre_data`. As `course` contains a value that is _not_ `NA`, which
is how _R_ represents missing values, you must use the parameter 
`na.strings = c("?", "NA")` in the appropriate `read.*()` function. 
If you need help, please see the appropriate help documentation via `?`.

**NB** The `*` in the `read.*()` statement is a placeholder for the type of file
you want to read in. 

```{r read-data}
tre_data = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wadefagen/Teachers-Ranked-As-Excellent-UIUC/master/TRE-UIUC-AllYears.csv", na.strings = c("?", "NA"))
```

**[2 points] (b)**  Retrieve the dimensional information for this data using
only one function.

```{r structure-data}
str(tre_data)
```

**[4 points] (c)** Perform a summary of the `tre_data`. Are there any summaries
that are surprising? What might have caused this? 

_Hint_ Consider looking at the structure of `tre_data`. 

```{r summary-data}
summary(tre_data)
```

I think that it is interesting that there about over 57,000 Excellent faculty at the U of I. I am also surprised that our biggest department is Music with over 3698 observations. We have over 2301 faculty in the ECE Department, probably because we are a top instituion in that field.

**[4 points] (d)** Fix the following code so that it:

1. doesn't error;
1. produces a graph; and 
1. hides the code.

_Hint_ for the last exercise look at different code chunk options.

```{r echo = FALSE, ggplot2-code}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(tre_data, aes(ranking)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap( ~role) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(y = "Frequency",
       x = "Excellency Rating")
```
